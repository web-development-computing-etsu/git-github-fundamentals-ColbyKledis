## Starting Github
Man, Github can be *very* confusing when first trying it out. Some of the features on Github are confusing at first glance.

## Interests
I have a group of friends that participate in Game Jams every so often, and I would enjoy learning about Github and how to use it effectivly so that I understand what is going on when viewing and editing Github pages

## Confusions
Forks and pull requests just dont make a ton of sense to me. I need to take the time to figure them out and understand them.
